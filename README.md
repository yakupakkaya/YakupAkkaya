# Hi there, I am Yakup Akkaya! 

I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience applying machine
learning and analytics to real-world problems in marketing and operations. My work spans predictive
modeling, optimization, computer vision, and large-scale data analysis. I built interpretable models to
developing reliable data pipelines. I have hands-on experience with Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy,
StatsModels, Seaborn), machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch), PySpark, and SQL. I’ve
worked with modern data platforms like Palantir Foundry and BigQuery for analytics, feature engineering,
and scalable workflows. I’m especially focused on building practical, explainable solutions that
drive business and product impact, and have also explored LLM-powered techniques to enhance data
enrichment and model insights.
